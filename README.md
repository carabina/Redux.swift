Redux.swift is an implementation of a predictable state container, written in Swift. Inspired by Redux and projects such as ReSwift, it aims to enforce separation of concerns and a unidirectional data flow by focusing your entire app state in a single data structure that cannot be mutated directly, instead relying on an action dispatch mechanism to describe changes.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

Redux.swift is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "Redux.swift"
```
